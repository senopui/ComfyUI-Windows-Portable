# Performance wheels for cu130 are installed via guarded installs in stage1.sh
# using the ai-windows-whl index for Python 3.13 + PyTorch nightly compatibility
#
# These include:
# - triton-windows<3.6
# - nunchaku
# - sageattention
# - spargeattention
#
# Note: Specific wheel URLs for cp312/cu128 are not compatible with cp313/cu130 nightly
# so we rely on the ai-windows-whl index to provide the correct versions.
