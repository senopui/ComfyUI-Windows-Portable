# Agent Guidance (docs)

Docs edits must stay factual and aligned with current behavior.

## Rules
- Don’t claim CI/test results you didn’t verify.
- If behavior differs between cu130 and cu130-nightly, say so clearly.
- Keep troubleshooting sections evidence-driven (link to Actions logs or manifests).

## Good docs updates
- Explain gating behavior for optional accelerators.
- Explain where manifests/artifacts live in Actions.
- Keep “nightly is experimental” explicit.
